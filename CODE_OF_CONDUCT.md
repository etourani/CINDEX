# CINDEX Project Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct adapts the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) for the needs of a scientific-software project used in academia and industry.

## Our Pledge
We as maintainers and contributors pledge to make participation in CINDEX a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or employment sector (academia/industry/government).

We also pledge to uphold **research integrity**: cite sources appropriately, do not claim ownership of others’ work, and represent data, models, and results honestly.

## Our Standards

### Positive behaviors
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints, experiences, and disciplines (chemistry, physics, ML, HPC, etc.).
- Give and accept constructive feedback gracefully.
- Provide actionable reproduction details (env, seed, data subset, command lines).
- Credit others’ work (e.g., papers, datasets, code) in issues, PRs, and docs.

### Unacceptable behaviors
- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary jokes.
- Trolling, personal attacks, or political baiting.
- Sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention.
- Public or private harassment (including DMs).
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Misrepresentation of results, plagiarism, or deceptive performance claims.
- Any other conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Maintainers’ Responsibilities
Project maintainers will clarify standards, respond to incidents, and may edit, remove, or reject comments/commits/issues/PRs that violate this Code. Maintainers may temporarily or permanently ban contributors for repeated or severe violations.

## Scope
This Code applies within all CINDEX spaces (repository, issues, PRs, discussions, docs, community calls) and when representing the project publicly (e.g., talks, posts referencing CINDEX affiliation).

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- **Preferred:** Email the maintainers at **conduct@cindex.dev** *(replace with your project address, e.g., `cindex-maintainers@…`)*.
- **Alternate:** Use GitHub’s “Report abuse” or email a maintainer listed in `README.md`.
- For security/privacy concerns (e.g., sensitive data in issues), use private channels first.

Reports will be reviewed promptly and treated confidentially. You will receive an acknowledgment and an outline of next steps.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers will follow these guidelines, adjusting to context and history:

1. **Correction** – Private or public note on the violation and request to stop.
2. **Warning** – Formal warning; continued violations may result in sanctions.
3. **Temporary Ban** – Time-limited exclusion from interactions.
4. **Permanent Ban** – Permanent removal from the community.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant v2.1** and tailored for scientific-software communities.
