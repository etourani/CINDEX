# CINDEX
Hands-on code for the Crystallinity Index (C-index): A physically interpretable descriptor for detecting crystalline regions in polymer simulations, combining entropy, bond-orientational order, and orientational order metrics. Includes preprocessing, feature calculation, and trajectory-wide application.
