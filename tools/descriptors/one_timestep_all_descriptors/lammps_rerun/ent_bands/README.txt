===========

This folder contains scripts for post-processing LAMMPS simulation output files 
to compute per-particle entropy and analyze directional entropy bands.

File Descriptions:
------------------

1. **in.rerun**
   - LAMMPS input script to rerun a previous simulation trajectory.
   - Used to compute per-particle entropy values (`S_i`) without averaging.
   - Ensure that the trajectory (`dump` file) and initial data file are present in the `../` directory.

2. **to_csv.py**
   - Python script to convert the LAMMPS `dump` file generated by `in.rerun` into a structured CSV file.
   - The CSV includes per-particle features such as position, entropy, or any additional LAMMPS computes.

3. **ent_bands.py**
   - Script to compute entropy averages across radial or directional bands for each particle.
   - Operates on the CSV output from `to_csv.py`.
   - Produces a new CSV file with entropy band features (used in ML or clustering tasks).

Usage Instructions:
-------------------

1. Run the `in.rerun` script with LAMMPS to extract `c_Entp`:
   ```bash
   lmp_mpi -in in.rerun

2. Convert the resulting dump file to CSV:
   python to_csv.py

3. Compute entropy bands:
   python ent_bands.py

This will generate the final output CSV file named `t2_averaged_S_shells_deltaR1point5.csv`.

Notes:
------

- These scripts assume the use of periodic boundary conditions.
- You may need to modify file paths inside the scripts depending on your directory structure.
- For advanced directional entropy band analysis and surface characterization, see:
