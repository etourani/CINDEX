===========

This folder contains scripts for post-processing LAMMPS simulation output files 
to compute per-particle average entropy value.

File Descriptions:
------------------

1. **in.rerun**
   - LAMMPS input script to rerun a previous simulation trajectory.
   - Used to compute per-particle average entropy values (`\bar S_i`).
   - Ensure that the trajectory (`dump` file) and initial data file are present in the `../` directory.

2. **to_csv.py**
   - Python script to convert the LAMMPS `dump` file generated by `in.rerun` into a structured CSV file.
   - The CSV includes per-particle features such as position, entropy, or any additional LAMMPS computes.



Usage Instructions:
-------------------

1. Run the `in.rerun` script with LAMMPS to extract `\bar S_i`:
   ```bash
   lmp_mpi -in in.rerun

2. Convert the resulting dump file to CSV:
   python to_csv.py


This will generate the final output CSV file named `dumpS_t2.csv`.

Notes:
------

- These scripts assume the use of periodic boundary conditions.
- You may need to modify file paths inside the scripts depending on your directory structure.
