===========

This folder contains scripts for post-processing LAMMPS simulation output files 
to compute per-particle Voronoi analyses, specifically voronoi volume, and number of faces. 

File Descriptions:
------------------

1. **in.rerun**
   - LAMMPS input script to rerun a previous simulation trajectory.
   - Used to compute per-particle voro values.
   - Ensure that the trajectory (`dump` file) and initial data file are present in the `../` directory.

2. **to_csv.py**
   - Python script to convert the LAMMPS `dump` file generated by `in.rerun` into a structured CSV file.
   - The CSV includes per-particle features such as position, volume, number of faces, or any additional LAMMPS computes.


Usage Instructions:
-------------------

1. Run the `in.rerun` script with LAMMPS to extract 'v', 'n_faces':
   ```bash
   lmp_mpi -in in.rerun

2. Convert the resulting dump file to CSV:
   python to_csv.py

This will generate the final output CSV file named `voro_t2.csv`.

Notes:
------

- These scripts assume the use of periodic boundary conditions.
- You may need to modify file paths inside the scripts depending on your directory structure.
